    "text": "🚀 My journey into programming and content creation wasn't typical – I started in an automotive technical school but quickly realized that I didn’t want to spend my life in a workshop fixing other people’s cars. I'm still passionate about the automotive world, but only when it comes to my own projects, without client pressure. Instead, I discovered that I'm passionate about creating – both in code and media. I love building applications, automating processes, and crafting engaging content. I initially studied computer science full-time, but I soon realized that I prefer learning practical skills that I can immediately apply – so I switched to part-time studies and began intensively developing my skills as a programmer and content creator.",

I love designing intuitive interfaces as much as building efficient systems and scripts where just a few lines of code can save days of work. I create web applications, websites, and process automation according to client requirements, but above all, with users in mind – they are the ones who use my work daily, so I always prioritize functionality, convenience, and real value.",

Thanks to a company I still collaborate with today (I started working there as a warehouse worker), I learned how to properly use my creativity and the magic of editing. I also picked up new skills like writing scripts, managing social media, and marketing strategies. In this role, too, I build something from nothing – I create creative videos and ads that work, as well as content that engages audiences. I also enjoy more relaxed content, such as gaming 🎮, vlogs 🎥, or videos with a more artistic touch.",

I plan to create my own game and board game, mainly for fun, but who knows – maybe someone will get hooked, and something interesting will come out of it. 🏋️‍♂️ Sports are the perfect escape from work for me. I usually go for the gym and Muay Thai – it helps me reset and focus on myself. Besides, sitting all day isn’t very healthy. 😆 🎸 I can play classical guitar, but I’m not great at it – I know a few campfire songs, and that’s about it. 😅 🐱 I love animals – I have a cat named Leon. 📹 In 2025, I want to start making YouTube videos, so if I get the courage to do it, there will be a YT button here linking to my channel. 🤝 If you made it to the end, you either have too much time, I really got you interested, or you’re just a cool person.",
